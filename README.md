# UX-Burlington
A recreation of the UX Burlington website

Goals I accomplished:
Recreate the website for UX Burlington a web UX conference
Learn to use an image for the thumbnail of the site
Make the speaker's images circles

Things I would change:
Too many things are centered making the site harder to read and the hierarchy of the website more distorted
The speaker's section, the last name, and title of the speakers, and the social media links in the footer all are slightly miss aligned
The way the sponsors are set up has little format however to meet all the requirements the conference likely had with its sponsors it seems it could be hard to make work well
Text is small
Text size doesn't help establish a hierarchy
